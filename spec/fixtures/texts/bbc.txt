A timelapse video showing thousands of planes flying in and out of the UK has been released by NATS (National Air Traffic Services).

Around 6,000 flights take off and land across the region during an average 24-hour period.

Air traffic experts collected radar data to create an overview of a typical day in the skies above the UK.
