The New York office of TBWA\Chiat\Day seems to be stringing together quite a few wins.

Less than two months after adding creative responsibilities for Travelers Insurance and Amway's Nutrilite, the office has landed Thomson Reuters' global creative business, sources tell Adweek. Revenue on the latest win is estimated at $2 million.

The first-quarter wins are much needed, given that the office's Being unit was cut from Kraft's creative roster late last year. The unit worked on brands like Planters and Kraft salad dressings.

Thomson Reuters' selection came after a review in which there were a handful of finalists, sources said. The identities of the other agencies could not immediately be confirmed.

As lead creative agency for the media conglomerate, TBWA\Chiat\Day succeeds Ogilvy & Mather, which had handled the brand since 2008.

Thomson Reuters' global media spending was not available, but in the U.S. alone last year, the company spent about $9 million in media, down slightly from $10 million in 2013, according to Kantar Media. In other years, however, spending was higher. In 2010, for example, the figure exceeded $21 million.

TBWA\Chiat\Day referred calls to Thomson Reuters, which declined to comment. But sources said that the company had told the contenders of its decision.
