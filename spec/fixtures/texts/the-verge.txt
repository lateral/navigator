Mexican jumping beans and magnets are the most magical things I can recall from childhood. I’m talking real magic, the fantastical truths contained in biology and physics, not the slick trickery of a Vegas hack. I would study them for hours, mystified in their wonder.

I felt the same sense of awe when Steve Jobs unveiled the MagSafe connector in 2006. But this time it was accompanied by an inaudible “duh” — of course laptop power cables should be connected by magnets as a way of preventing accidents. But not just MacBooks, Microsoft’s Surface would ultimately adopt a magnetic connector. Pebble watches, too, and soon the Apple Watch. But not headphones, even now when much of the world dangles $600 smartphones from a white rubbery thread. Let’s face it: a pair of Bluetooth headphones solves the wire risk but it’s yet another device that requires batteries or charging.

A few have tried (and failed) to bring the magnetic headphone adapter to market. The obstacles are many: intellectual property rights, miniaturization, sound quality, and making sure that audio redirects to the device’s speakers when the magnets release (but the adapter is still in the jack). Now a small company from Akron Ohio says it has the solution, but needs a little help from Kickstarter to make it a reality.

I’m skeptical, but also chronically midwestern in my hope that Magzet can pull it off.
